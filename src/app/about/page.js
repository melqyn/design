              Melanie is an exceptionally driven person, always ready to take on challenges. She challenged herself
              to pick up front-end web development and was a major contributor for researching into the problem
              areas of flying with pets and also on food tech. Melanie adapted well into the dynamic innovation lab
              environment and has shown perseverance in pushing through ideas and turning them into working
              proof-of-concepts amid the uncertainties and tight timeline. Being a good team player, Melanie was

            I love most things creative and hands on - I sketch, paint, crochet and make pottery at times.
