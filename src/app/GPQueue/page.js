    Mid-fidelity: Addition of Map-based Interactions
  </h2>
  <p className="text-[#636363] leading-loose pb-8">
    User testings on wireframes led to some minor tweaks to the functions, such as the addition of Singpass login method and a sort feature when searching for GP clinics. 
  </p>

  <p className="text-[#636363] leading-loose pb-8">
  However, I would like to highlight the addition of map-based interactions as I iterate from wireframing to mid-fidelity prototyping. During wireframe user testing, users noted that it was difficult for them to mentally locate the different clinics based on a text address. This problem is especially evident when they are trying to compare between different clinics, resulting in users noting a need to separately search up clinic locations to compare convenience of travel routes. 
  </p>

  <p className="text-[#636363] leading-loose pb-8">
  Hence, I created a visual-based map interface where users can access clinic location and wait time information more visually. This interface aims to facilitate the comparison of queue wait times between different clinics, as well as mobile movements to and fro clinics.

Some design features to look at are font sizes, button sizes as well as designing for memory and concentration (Sergey, 2019). In designing for this alternative target group, there is also a need to focus on education of technology."}
      paragraph2={"Another important consideration is to look at the possibility of integrating GPQueue with the current Health Appointment System developed by Open Government Products (OGP). This is to reduce the number of touchpoints users have to go through to access the health services they require. By providing a centralized platform for scheduling appointments with healthcare providers, be it advanced appointments or drop in visits, it will be more convenient for users to manage their healthcare appointments from one application. Moreover, integrating with the HAS can also ensure that GPQueue operates with accurate and up-to-date information. Aligning with an already established system also helps in maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations and standards. Additionally, the association with OGP can help to enhance the credibility of this application, similar to how my user testing results showed that users feel more secure when using a familiar system such as Singpass."}
